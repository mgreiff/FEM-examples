This is meant as supplementary materials and help to aid understanding of the
algorithms presented in the book by Stephen Krenk, see the Bib-entry below.

The general idea is to provide solutions implemented in Matlab to a selection
of the assignments in the book, specifically exercises

* 1.5
* 2.5
* 2.6
* 6.1
* 6.2
* 6.3

Complete

The plan3* methods were all written and verified, run testPlan3Methods to
test. See figure for result.

a) COMPLETE - The data.m script was written to show the mesh and pints
              where boundary conditions are set, with x (green) and y (red).
b) COMPLETE - The nrchap6.m algorithm solves the system with a total L formulation,
              and gives good results.
c) COMPLETE - I don't know which force is reffered to when considering the
              force-displacement curve, as we dont have an externa? force
              to work, with but it doesn't feel too important.
